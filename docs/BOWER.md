We use [Bower](http://bower.io) to manage front-end dependencies. `cd` to the directory where `bower.json` is stored and run:
* First we have to install npm and nodejs. Run the following:
```sudo apt-get install npm```

* Then run the following command to get Bower:
```sudo npm install -g bower```

* Finally run the following command to install the dependencies from bower.json:
```
bower install
```
